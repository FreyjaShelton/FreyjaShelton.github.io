				A game I created for the 2024 Pirate Software Game Jam where you play
				as a little slime that is trying to cover as much of the pirate ship in slime as she can.
				The theme for the game jam was "It's Spreading" so I interpreted that as spreading slime all over the stage.
				I was the developer.
				My wife, Sephora, helped me with some of the art assets.
				My friend, Lavonte Pugh, created the music.
